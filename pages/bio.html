        <p> Born 1998 in Sydney, Australia. Lives and works in Melbourne on stolen Wurundjeri country.
            <br>
            <br>
            Oskar Backent is a printmaker, Video Artist and Drawer.
            <br>
            <br>
            Backent’s practice attempts to categorise and make sense of personal histories, pop culture and its influences in aesthetically uncanny forms.
            <br>
            <br>
            Through pirating pre-existing modes of cultural production: his work seeks to confront the possibilities of being shaped by the content that is pirated and gleaned from.
            <br>
            <br>
            Broken computer monitors and 2000s digital photo screens are utilised to contrast drypoint printmaking forms; creating a tension between the traditional and the technologically obsolete. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Engaging with forms of connection and disconnection, looping and building, an immersive display of developing influences are put on full display. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Backent’s work is concerned with constructed and absorbed realities, technological obsolescence and the rise of Retromania: a cultural obsession with nostalgia, with humour and a playful perspective being integral to his approach.
